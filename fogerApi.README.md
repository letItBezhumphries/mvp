Folger Digital Texts API
The API is a work in progress. For now, here's what we have:

To help explore the API, we've created a simple form that will generate URLs to access objects in the API. It is not exhaustive, nor will it return valid results if the variables you select do not correlate to an existing object or function.

Play:	
Function:	
The URLs generated by the above form are based on the play code, function name, and additional parameters where appropriate. For example, the URL to see line 12 of Macbeth is https://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/Mac/ftln/0012, where "Mac" is the play code, "ftln" is the function name to retrieve a single line of the play, and 0012 is the Folger Throughline Number. With the play codes and function names listed, you can write your own URLs by hand, as an alternative to using the form on this page.

Functions:
ftln (+ Folger through line number): returns the spoken text at that FTLN
word (+ word id) : returns information about that word
segment (+ object id) : returns the text of that xml:id
text: returns only the spoken text in that play
charText: returns a list of characters arranged according to amount of lines spoken, with a link to each character's entire spoken text
charTextMinus: returns a list of characters arranged according to amount of lines spoken, with a link to the play's spoken text, minus this character
concordance: lists the words used (in spoken text) and their frequency
monologue (+ optional line count): provides a list of speeches longer than the given line count (defaults to 30 lines)
onStage (+ ftln): returns a list of characters on stage at that line
charChart: provides a graphical representation of who is on stage across a timeline of the play
parts: provides parts or cue scripts for each character
witScript: provides "witScripts" for each character. "Witness" or "Witmore" scripts attempt to show what a character sees. They offer the play text only when that character is on stage.
sounds: returns a list of all stage directions that contain sounds (i.e., "music," "flourish," "thunder")
